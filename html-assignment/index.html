                    Emily is an extremely creative person and is influenced heavily by popular culture. She enjoys playing piano and bass, which she has been doing for 18 and eight years respectively. She has played with the <abbr title="Ottawa Pops Orchestra">OPO</abbr> since 2018; the next season will be her 5<sup>th</sup> with the group. She draws frequently and creates costumes and props in her spare time, and thoroughly enjoys photography and photo editing. However, her biggest hobby is gaming, which <sup>(unfortunately)</sup> takes up most of her time.
