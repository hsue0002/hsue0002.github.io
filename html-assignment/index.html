                <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Emily Hsueh is currently a student at Algonquin College studying Interactive Media design and a reporter and videographer for The Equity newspaper in Shawville, Quebec. Originally from Ottawa, she studied journalism at the University of Ottawa and Algonquin College and graduated in 2020. She has been working at The Equity since June 2020 but will soon return to Ottawa to continue her studies.
               
                    Emily is an extremely creative person and is influenced heavily by popular culture. She enjoys playing piano and bass, which she has been doing for 18 and eight years respectively. She draws frequently and creates costumes and props in her spare time, and thoroughly enjoys photography and photo editing. However , her biggest hobby is gaming, which (unfortunately) takes up most of her time.
